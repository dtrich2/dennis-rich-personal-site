#A researcher with experience in the very small.

I'm devoted to process-based inquiry. As technology grows smaller and faster, the only way we can hope to keep up is by smarter and more precise processes. I've worked with diverse systems from waterproof nanopores to GaN semiconductors, and I have the familiarity necessary to remain ahead of the curve.

#A quick yet methodical thinker.

Since my high schooling at the prestigous Illinois Math and Science Academy, I've had to quickly assimilate knowledge and develop conclusions and, more importantly, results. I'm more than just comfortable in a challenging environment: I'm at home.

#An effective communicator.

A successful investigation means nothing if one fails to communicate his results. My time as an improvisational actor taught me wit, clarity, and speed. I've been schooled in public speaking, and have over five years of experience tutoring my peers. Conveyed by such expert means, the discoveries I've made over the years couldn't help but be noticed.
